## cat-cat v2

Initially this little app was my first exploration into react.js, a simple thing based off https://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial/ changed to include cats rather than just plain old comments.

After a few years experience in building things on the front-end with React, this little repo has been upgraded with a slightly beefier project that handles the fetching of cat breeds from https://docs.thecatapi.com, populating a list of selectable items with dynamic data, managing state and props using Redux, basic routing, and an atomic style approach towards component styling.

## SET UP

WITH NODE:
run `npm install` to install the required npm packages and `npm start` to get a local version up and running
