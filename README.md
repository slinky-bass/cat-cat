########## c^tc^t

This little app was my exploration into react.js after initially going through the tutorial. 
It takes thehttps://github.com/reactjs/react-tutorial/ and changes it slightly to include cats rather than just plain old comments.

########## SET UP

Getting this running is super easy, as the base tutorial has been set up to 'plug and play'.

WITH NODE: 

```sh
$npm install 
$node server.js
```

########## TO VIEW
visit <http://localhost:3000/>.

Or change the port number by setting the `$PORT` environment variable before invoking any of the scripts above:

```sh
PORT=3001 node server.js
```
